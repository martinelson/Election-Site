 # TX 2020 Election Info Site

 ## Purpose

 This project was created to help provide information into local Texas elections during the 2020 election cycle. It gives information on who was running for each election in the federal, state, county, district races.

 ## Information Sources 

 Election information was obtained from the Secretary of State website: sos.state.tx.us and put into a MongoDB database which is connected in the **config** folder as well as the list of offices, which are located in the **objects**. 

 In addition, the site is also connected to the FEC API, pulling campaign finance data on the Federal level candidates. 

 A News API is also utilized, querying information on TX Elections. 

 While the 2020 election is over, and the FEC and News data has changed, it's still up and running for anyone curious about the current TX Election news, and any updated financial data about the candidates who ran in 2020.

The project is hosted on Heroku at the following URL: https://glacial-oasis-36134.herokuapp.com/

It is hosted on a free tier so it may take a moment for the application to wake up.

## Context
This was my major first project I successfully completed while learning web development, and I am motivated to make more about helping promote education, and civic information.
